# NetflixClone
NetflixClone is a responsive web app built with HTML and CSS that mimics Netflixâ€™s homepage design. It features a sleek layout with movie thumbnails, navigation bar, and hover effects. This project helps beginners practice modern web design, responsive grids, and UI styling by recreating a popular streaming platform interface.
